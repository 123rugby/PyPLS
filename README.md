# PyPLS
This is a Partial Least Squares (PLS) package based on Python.

Partial least squares (PLS) is an extension of PCA in which both the  X and Y data are considered. In PCA, only the X data is considered. The goal of the PLS analysis is to build an equation that predicts Y values based on X data.
