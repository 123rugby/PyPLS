# PyPLS
This is a Partial Least Squares (PLS) package based on Python.

Partial least squares (PLS) is an extension of PCA in which both the  $\mathbf{X}$ and  $\mathbf{Y}$ data are considered. In PCA, only the $\mathbf{X}$ data is considered. The goal of the PLS analysis is to build an equation that predicts $\mathbf{Y}$ values based on $\mathbf{X}$ data.
